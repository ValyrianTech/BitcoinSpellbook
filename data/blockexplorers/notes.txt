Some notes about blockexplorers:

Due to the response data each explorer gives or doesn't give, there can be minor differences in the results!!!


- 0-confirmation transactions are not included in results!!
- Bech32 only supported by Blockchain.info currently!


Blocktrail.com:
- block timestamp is in UTC format which requires converting back to unix timestamp, possible timezone issues!
- no pushtx, uses blockchain.info instead
- no bech32
- when requesting all transactions of an address, the inputs of each transaction does not contain the sequence
- i have noticed some issues on testnet where the total number of transactions of an address is not equal to the actual number of transactions given

Insight:
- Total received balance and total sent balance are calculated wrong when the change address is the same as the sending address, as a result, when calculating
the balance, all transactions need to be retrieved.
- When retrieving transactions, outputs that are currently a 0-conf transaction will be displayed as 'spent' unlike blocktrail and blockchain.info
- no bech32

Blockchain.info:
- Block size is different than Blocktrail.com and Insight explorers
- The inputs of a transaction do not contain the corresponding txid for some fucked up reason, they only return their internal tx_index, resolving this would take too many requests!
